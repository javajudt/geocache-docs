# Geocache Labels

By Geocaching user [JavaJudt](https://www.geocaching.com/p/default.aspx?guid=671d8afd-41ed-4c50-8e8d-89ac675109fc).

This repository contains serveral custom designed, print-at-home labels to mark geocache containers. Each type of label has a `*.docx` (Microsoft Word) file for editing and a `*.pdf` file for printing. There is also a README file that corresponds to each type of label. This file will show what kind (brand and style/template) of label the labels were designed to be printed on.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to the repository by making constructive edits to existing labels, or by adding your own! Each type of label should have its own directory, and there should be three files in that directory:

```
geocache-docs
├── label-type
|   ├── README.md
|   ├── label-type.docx
|   └── label-type.pdf
```

Replace `label-type` with a concise name of your label. If you don't use Microsoft Word, feel free to submit a PR with your file of choice.
